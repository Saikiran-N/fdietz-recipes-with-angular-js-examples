# Behavior-Driven Development

BDD is a variant of [Test-Driven Development](https://github.com/brettshollenberger/ruby_wiki/blob/master/RSpec.md), which emphasizes the behavior of the application rather than its precise implementation. 

The primary tools of BDD are integration tests and unit tests.
