# Computer Networks: Protocols and Layering

Networks need modularity to manage complexity, the same way a webapp must be modular to manage complexity. 

Networks have many concerns:

* Make and break connections
* Find a path through the network
* Transfer information reliably
* Transfer arbitrary length information
* Send as fast as the network allows
* Share bandwidth among users
* Secure information in transit
* Add new hosts to the network
