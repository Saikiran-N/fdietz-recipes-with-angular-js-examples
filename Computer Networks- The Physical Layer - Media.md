# Physical Layer: Types of Media

Media propagates signals that carry bits of information. 

## Wires - Twisted Pair

Very common; used in LANs and telephone lines. Twists reduce radiated signal.

## Wires - Coaxial Cable

Also common. Better shielding for better performance. Can carry more data faster across longer distance. 

## Fiber

Long, thin, pure strands of glass. Enormous bandwidth (high speed) over long distances. 

## Wireless

Sender radiates signal over a region. It can reach potentially many receivers. Nearby signals with the same frequency however will interfere at a receiver; need to coordinate use. 

We must be careful to allocate WiFi to a small portion of the radio spectrum. 

The portion of the spectrum used for WiFi have an interesting story. The frequencies we like for data communication tend to be in the microwave band (WiFi and 3G).
