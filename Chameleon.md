## Goals:

Modularization as "number one theme."

1) Centralize & modularize Javascript modules & CSS

* Bower for front-end modules
* `npm` for back-end modules
* `edmodo-bootstrap`: Common assets (LESS files & custom Javascript modules)

2) Rendr (thin Node.js layer) - Run Backbone apps on the server

3) How it interacts with OneAPI

## My entry point:
