# Git Style

* Prefix feature branch names with your initials
* Write a good commit message
	* Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
	* More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it up in about 70 chars or so. 
	* In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email, and the rest of the text as the body. 
	* Remember your Inbound Guru's wisdom: the subject line is what others use to determine whether or not they'll read the body. Write a good title. 
	* Write your commit message in the imperative ("Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug."
	* Place a line break between the subject and body. 

Formatting
----------
* Avoid inline comments
* Break long lines after 80 characters
* Don't include spaces after `(`, `[` or before `]`, `)`
* Use spaces around operators, after commas, after colons and semicolons, and around { and }
* Use Unix-style line endings (`\n`).
* Use uppercase for SQL keywords (`SELECT`) and lowercase for SQL identifiers

Naming
----------
* Avoid abbreviations
* Avoid types in names (`user_array`)
*
