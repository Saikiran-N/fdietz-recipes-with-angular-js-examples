# REST

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a big phrase that describes a very simple set of concepts:

1) Getting and setting values on persisted data (usually in a database)
2) Within distributed programs (via HTTP)
3) Across various, unknown protocols and data types (whatever the client, server, and database decide to use)
4) In predictable ways (where HTTP verbs map to CRUD verbs, and presentation resources are separated from data resources)
