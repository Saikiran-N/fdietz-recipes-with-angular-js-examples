# Test-Driven Development

_For implementation notes, see [RSpec.](https://github.com/brettshollenberger/ruby_wiki/blob/master/RSpec.md)_

A defining characteristic of TDD is writing tests first--by writing a failing test and then writing the code to make it pass, we ensure the test actually tests the functionality we think it does. 

The development cycle of TDD is fail-implement-pass (and possibly refactor), or red-green-refactor.

If you don't know what a solution will even look like, start this cycle with a spike. The general shape of a solution will help in writing the test.
