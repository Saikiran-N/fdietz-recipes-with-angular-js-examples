# Integration Tests

Known as request specs in the context of RSpec.

Integration tests allow us to simulate the actions of a user interacting with our application using a web browser. 

Combined with the natural-language syntax of Capybara, integration tests provide a powerful method to test our app's functionality without having to manually check each page with a browser.
