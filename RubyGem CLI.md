# RubyGem Command-Line Interface

The RubyGem CLI is closely coupled with the [Ruby Version Manager(RVM) CLI](http://google.com), which you should check out for additional details.

#### The Important Commands:

`gem install` does what it says: It installs the specified gem. To find the gem, it searches rubygems.org, so gems must have unique names. 

		gem install rails

`gem install` will install the gem into the current [gemset](https://github.com/brettshollenberger/ruby_wiki/blob/master/Gemsets.md). If the previous sentence doesn't make sense, check out the articles on [gemsets]() and rvm commands (listed above) first to familiarize yourself.
