# Websocket

Websockets are a part of the HTML5 connectivity specification that formalize a full-duplex, bi-directional communication standard between a client and server. Websockets were created to server a different purpose than the Hypertext Transport Protocol, which was designed to deliver single documents. In recent years, as web pages gradually became web applications, developers have begun filling the gaps between HTTP and real-time applications. We introduced polling, a method of making synchronous requests to the server at a specified interval, which may or may not send back information to update the page with. We introduced long-polling, a similar process in which the server holds requests open until it has data to return, which minimizes the number of HTTP requests and unnecessary HTTP headers in low message volume scenarios, but is just as inefficient in high-interactivity, high message volume projects.

Sockets on the other hand allow for bi-directional, asynchronous messaging; messages are full-duplex, meaning that both sides can talk at whatever interval they want to. HTTP transactions are half-duplex, like walkie-talkies, which allow only one side to send a message at a time. Websockets improve performance and simplicity of transferring data in web applications.
