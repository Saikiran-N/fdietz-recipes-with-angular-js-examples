#Schema

> Behavioral psychologists use the word _schema_ to describe how humans learn: By chunking like information into manageable parts. A two-year-old's conception of "doggy" might be a four-legged animal until they learn to differentiate "kitties."

Databases, like humans, can learn to group like parts in their extraordinarily limited world views. Also like human's, a database's most common reaction to information that doesn't fit into its schema is to ignore it.

Databases and two-year-olds can be taught new schemas; in Rails, we change the schema of tables through migrations.
