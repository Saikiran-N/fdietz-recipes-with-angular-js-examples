#Ruby Wiki

>Think of this wiki as Severus Snape's copy of _Advanced Guide to Potion Making_. The actual contents are canonical: stolen Thoughtbot thoughts and Ruby Style Guide recommendations mixed in with my own marginalia to add clarity and insights helpful to me (and hopefully other young Rubyists).

>--This Book Is Property of the Half-Blood Prince (_kidding_)

This work-in-progress is arranged by topic. Go nuts.
